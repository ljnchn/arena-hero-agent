A deterministic, long-running aggressive tactic for [Arena Hero](https://doc.arenahero.io/), maintained by [WuDiWangWaSai](https://github.com/WuDiWangWaSai). It uses the official Python SDK and includes a live tactical dashboard with replayable vision history and public leaderboards.

This is a community project, not an official Arena Hero product.

Community acknowledgement: this project recognizes and supports the [LINUX DO community](https://linux.do/).

## Strategy

The default force grows through four production stages:

| Stage | Workers | Vanguards | Rangers | Population |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Establish | 8 | 1 | 1 | 10 |
| Mobilize | 12 | 3 | 4 | 19 |
| Expand | 18 | 6 | 8 | 32 |
| Overwhelm | 18 | 15 | 17 | 50 |

At 50 living Units, the Core capacity is 250 resources under `max(10, population * 5)`.

- Production continues while assaults are active and keeps a small Core repair reserve. Emergency defenders may spend that reserve.
- Visible hostile Cores are the primary offensive target. Escorts and remote interception do not automatically cancel the raid.
- Only one Vanguard and one Ranger remain as permanent Core guards; the rest attack, pursue visible enemies, or patrol an expanding perimeter.
- Once population reaches 40, resources reach 30, and the Core is healthy and not threatened, a non-guard Vanguard contests the Champion Beacon.
- The Core does not migrate for routine expansion or Beacon pressure. Workers clear the production cell; the Core moves only for verified survival threats.
- Optional local multi-account alliances share non-secret battlefield state, exclude each other from targeting and threat logic, and safely rally smaller accounts' Cores toward the largest account.
- Arena Hero has no territory-ownership command. "Expansion" here means accumulated vision, outward patrols, enemy removal, and map control.

The tactic targets gameplay rules v0.14 and `arena-hero` SDK 0.2.9. See [strategy](docs/strategy.md), [threat response](docs/threat-response.md), and [configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Tactical Dashboard

Every accepted Turn is stored in a bounded SQLite history. The dashboard provides:

- current and historical map state;
- explored cells, obstacles, resources, and remembered enemy Cores;
- friendly movement trails and submitted move lines;
- Tick playback, timeline navigation, pan, and zoom;
- event feed and public damage, Core-destruction, and Beacon leaderboards.
- coordinate orders for an explicitly selected Core, Worker, Vanguard, or Ranger UUID, with cancellation; Core orders use safe routing and alliance-occupied cells remain blocked;
- Sakura-pink map markers for allied Cores and Units using their latest shared alliance positions;
- local unit/Core destruction-participation totals, named enemy Core victories, incoming attacks, losses, and confirmed revenge targets from recorded events.

Start it after the Agent has begun writing `arena_history.sqlite3`:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m arena_dashboard --history-db .\arena_history.sqlite3
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765). The leaderboard proxy uses the public Arena Hero endpoint and never sends the Agent API key.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- An Arena Hero API key
- PowerShell on Windows

Runtime dependencies are hash-locked. Credentials and private runtime logs are ignored and must never be committed.

## Windows

Run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/WuDiWangWaSai/arena-hero-agent.git
cd arena-hero-agent
.\scripts\bootstrap.ps1
.\start_agent.ps1
```

On first run, the script securely prompts for an API key if neither `.env` nor `ARENA_HERO_API_KEY` provides one. It writes `arena_farmer.log`, records `arena_history.sqlite3`, starts the dashboard in the same CMD window, opens the browser, rotates logs, and retries transient failures. Use `-NoDashboard` to run only the Agent.

From Command Prompt, use:

```bat
start_agent.cmd
```

Optional PowerShell overrides use a single dash:

```powershell
.\start_agent.ps1 -WorkerTarget 18 -BeaconPolicy pursue -HistoryDb .\arena_history.sqlite3
```

Run two accounts in the same CMD window and dashboard. The first launch securely prompts for the secondary API key:

```powershell
.\start_agent.ps1 -SecondaryEnvFile .\.env.secondary
```

The accounts keep separate history databases while sharing local alliance identity and scout coverage. The dashboard merges explored cells, obstacles, resource history, and enemy vision, and both tactics treat the other account's Core and Units as allies.

Stop the foreground Agent with `Ctrl+C`; the dashboard process started by it is stopped at the same time. Code changes require an Agent restart.

## Production deployment note

The repository still contains the systemd transaction scripts required by the separately managed production host. They are not part of the supported local Windows workflow and are intentionally left untouched.

## Verification

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall -q arena_farmer.py arena_history.py arena_dashboard.py arena_health.py arena_supervisor.py arena_optimizer.py arena_version_monitor.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip check
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\check_secrets.py
```
